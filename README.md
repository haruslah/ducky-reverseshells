# ducky-reverseshells

A collection of Duckyscripts focused on reverse shells, mainly for Windows environments.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

This repo gathers practical Duckyscripts that automate reverse shell setups. Each script comes with comments explaining how it works, what it targets, and how to customize it.

## Important

**Use only on machines you own or have permission to test.**  
These scripts can disable security features and run remote codeâ€”use responsibly.
And seriously, donâ€™t go plugging this into your friendâ€™s laptop ðŸ‘€

## Repo Layout

- `/windows/` â€” Duckyscripts targeting Windows environments (PowerShell, CMD, etc.)  

## Getting Started

- Update URLs and filenames in the scripts to your payload locations.  
- Always test in a safe environment first.
